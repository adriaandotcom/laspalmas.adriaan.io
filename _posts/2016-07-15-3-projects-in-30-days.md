Working 3 days so I could use the other 4 days to fill up with my own projects. I'm not doing that. And I'm going to change that now. While being on the beach yesterday I realized I didn't do my own projects anymore and kept postponing those. There are lots of reasons for it like working as a freelancer, going to the beach, sleeping untill 12:00, â€¦.

My [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/adriaanvanrossum) reads this:

> I moved to Las Palmas where I can be creative, enjoy the perfect weather and can work on cool projects too. I prefer working 3 days a week as the other projects fill up the rest of the week.

This was one the reasons to go abroad, so how to change this? I calculated the amount of days I have until the end of the year. It shows me I have 2,5 months of not crazy friends around or roadtripp'n:

If you work 3 days a week you can reserve 3 days per week for your other projects. So that is what I'm going to do.

```
3 days x 4 week x 2.5 months = 30 days
```

For the critical people (like myself): I know there are more weeks in a month, but 30 days sounds nice. I will do 3 projects of 10 days each in those 30 days. It is not about a pixel perfect (which I probably find hard) app or website, but it will be a simple **(live) version** of every project.

To make it official, here are the 3 deadlines:
 - Project I - August, 6th
 - Project II - October, 13th
 - Project III - November, 4th
 
In the next blog I will go into the first project.
