title: Before I go
---

I just want to write down what my expectations are before moving to Las Palmas. Some curious people do want to know why I'm going there, so I want to elloborate a little. I will communicate in English because of the broader audience, but it is not my native language so feel free to correct my grammer with the top right button *(on GitHub)*.

## Why am I leaving?

First of all, I'm not going there to find a great new future. I'm not unhappy how things are going in The Netherlands but I know there are some things that could be better. When I worked for GoldRepublic (on the project [nx'change](https://www.nxchange.com/)) in Amsterdam for a few months I realised that their company culture didn't fit my needs. It was a typical 9:00 till 18:00 job, five days a week. I do not know where the saying 9:00 till 17:00 is coming from, but I only see that at govermental positions. Anyway, the job itself was not bad and I got payed pretty well. But I thought, this could not be my life.

There I started looking for other opportunities. For a long time I had this idea to work remotely. Maybe a place with some nice beach closeby and some interresting people around.
