In [the previous blog post](https://laspalmas.adriaan.io/work-24-hours-in-two-days) I wrote about changing my working schedule to 2 days of 12 hours. I don't think I want to change that ever, you get a lot of work done. You should not do it two days in a row, but if you work the day in between for just 8 hours it works pretty well. But now it is time for something more extreme.

I like to do some more extreme things, like I did with [demaandvanadriaan.nl](https://demaandvanadriaan.nl/) (in Dutch). Tomorrow I will work for 24 hours straight. I also found a worrier in this battle: Chace (my roommate). Our goal is to get a shitload done in those 24 hours. We'll work the full Thursday, which will start at 12 a.m. until 12 p.m.

Both Natasha and MiglÄ— suggested to use the [Pomodoro technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/). This technique has the following fundamentals:

1. Choose a task you'd like to get done
2. Set the Pomodoro for 25 minutes
3. Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings
4. When the Pomodoro rings, put a checkmark on a paper
5. Take a short break
6. Every 4 Pomodoro, take a longer break

And if you replace Pomodoro with a regular timer, you are good to go (otherwise you have to buy expensive timers with their company name on it).
