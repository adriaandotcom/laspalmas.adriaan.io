I just want to write down what my expectations are before moving to Las Palmas. Some curious people do want to know why I'm going there, so I want to elloborate a little. I will communicate in English because of the broader audience, but it is not my native language so feel free to correct my grammer with the top right button *(on GitHub)*.

## Why am I leaving?

First of all, I'm not going there to find a great new future. I'm not unhappy how things are going in The Netherlands but I know there are some things that could be better. When I worked for GoldRepublic (on the project [nx'change](https://www.nxchange.com/)) in Amsterdam for a few months I realised that their company culture didn't fit my needs. It was a typical 9:00 till 18:00 job, five days a week. I do not know where the saying - 9:00 till 17:00 - is coming from, but I only see that at govermental positions. Anyway, the job itself was not bad and I got payed pretty well. But I thought, this could not be my life.

There I started looking for other opportunities. For a long time I had this idea to work remotely. Maybe a place with some nice beach closeby and some interresting people around me. I was looking for a place which is kind of close (relatively cheap flights) and has a nice climate. I think the moment Las Palmas crossed my mind was when I was on a train from Harlem to Amsterdam *(thanks Jeroen & Marieke)*. I looked up the city on Wikipedia, Googled some pictures and did some research on their internet speed. They even had viber!

On that moment I knew that I had to go there. No idea for how long (and I still don't know), but that was the plan. I also knew that this was not possible with my current job so I asked Christian to introduce me at my previous job. The Member Get Member Company (formerly Social Shop) had only two developers at that time. I know my wishes are not regular, but if you don't try you will never get extraordinary luxery, so I asked if I could work remotely from Las Palmas and for just three days a week. They agreed and even gave me a golden MacBook. I'm very grateful to this campany and its founder Sander!

Via a lot of Facebooking I found a nice CoWorking space called CoWorkingC, it looks good, and probably is. That will give me an easy opportunity to meet new people and have a place where I can concentrate on my work.

So the income is stable and I have a place to work, now it is time for to find a apartment. With a lot of Google Translate, aswering strange questions about my sexuality and contacting a lot of ads I [found a nice place](/my-place). The way housing agencies make money is the same as in The Netherlands, one month rent as the agency fee. It always hurts to pay so much for just a connection with the owner, but this agency did quite a lot (even got me an internet connection) for their fee.

## What do you expect?

Do I know this? Maybe, the basics are there, a job, workingspace and an apartment. 

Just before my move to Las Palmas I got the opportunity to see this great view. The contrast will be high in temperature, but in beauty hopefully not ;-)
