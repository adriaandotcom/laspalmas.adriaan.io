title: Planning to move to Las Palmas?
---

You are probably looking around on the internet to find out if Gran Ganaria of Las Palmas is a great place to move to.
I'm of course a little biased because I've choosen to live there, but here are my reasons why I think it is great.

## Community
There is an [active community on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/201877786658754/) where you can ask a lot of questions and there you can find a lot of answers to already asked questions.

I just copy pasted the pinned post of the [*Gran Canaria Digital Nomads*-group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/201877786658754/):

### Spanish language
I did some Spanish lessons with Laura León from [La Casita de Laura](https://www.facebook.com/lacasitadelauralpgc), she is great! The one-to-one lessons are great for getting advice specific for your needs. [Here is an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8guaQ6bPt0) with her. Laura also offers some places to stay, so if you want to come here, let her know.

There is also a Facebook-group called [Multicultural language exchange - Las Palmas de Gran Canaria](https://www.facebook.com/groups/122339838104153/). They have about 2 meetings a week and everyone can participate. The learning Spanish is more an excuse for drinking some beers, but you should try it.

There is also the [Michel Thomas](http://www.michelthomas.com/) Spanish lessons. You can download them via their shop (but it is quite expensive) or just steal it from a torrent website. The learning happens via listening sessions of a total of 8 hours. After that you can communicate pretty well in Spanish (I'm told).

## Moving
Here are some tips when you decided to move to Gran Canaria.

### Living
There are a lot of websites, but I got these from the locals.

* [La Casita de Laura](https://www.facebook.com/lacasitadelauralpgc)
* [idealista.com](http://www.idealista.com) (found [my place](/my-place) with this one)
* [enalquiler.com](http://www.enalquiler.com) (I like this one)
* [pisos.com](http://www.pisos.com) (did not get a lot of responses here)
* [vibbo.com/pisos/](http://www.vibbo.com/pisos/) (was [segundamano.es](http://www.segundamano.es))

It is also pretty easy to just come here and ask around. The first 2 weeks I was offered 3 places to stay, so it is not that hard.

### Stay connected
I use [Orange SIM Mundo 2GB](http://www.simmundo.es/) and I'm pretty happy about it. It is a pay-as-you-go contract, so you just put money on it and you can use 2GB per month for € 15,-. Calls to other Mondo clients are free (if you charged in the last 30 days) and calling to mobile phones in The Netherlands is around € 0,13 per minute. Most people here are saying this is a great deal. 

There is also a [deal from vodafone](http://www.vodafone.es/tienda/particulares/es/catalogo/ficha/prepago/movil/tarjeta/sim_vodafone_internacional_smartphone/) where you can have some international phonecalls. 60 minutes for 15 euro's. I don't think it is better then the Orange one.

### Social security number
If you want to live in Spain and have the privileges of the locals you will need a *NIE*. [Download the form here](http://extranjeros.empleo.gob.es/es/ModelosSolicitudes/Mod_solicitudes2/), you can also download the English version and use that to fill in the official Spanish form.
